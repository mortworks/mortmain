My name is Peter Morton and I'm an Open Source Teacher. That means I'm an independent-minded and outward-facing educational professional with an open source philosophy towards work, practice, and personal growth. 

In my core role, I teach both English and Computing. And in spite of the associative differences between these two subjects, I find that most of the time, for the young people I work with, trying to master these subjects boils down to the same thing. Yes, really.

I spend my working life helping young people learn to observe things; to abstract and explain how things work (and to what end in the world); and to readapt those texts or programming constructs on their own terms, in their own fresh and independent way, and with increasing confidence and fluency. That is as pertinent to a novel by Charles Dickens as it is to an algorithm written in Python. 

I've taught in UK secondary schools for over 10 years (both in the independent and state sectors) teaching young people from Year 7 up to A Level and International Baccalaureate.

Welcome to my website. This is where I share with you, as it evolves, my portfolio of work. I hope that children, teachers, programmers, and other professionals alike will find something of value here.
