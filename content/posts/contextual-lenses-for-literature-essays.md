> **Student:** \[_politely_\] Sir, what do you mean by 'context'? What is 'context'? I mean, you keep telling us we have to include it in our literature essays - but what actually is it?

> **Me:** Well, I'm so glad you asked...

## How to use this list

This list is designed to help you build up better fluency and competence with contextual lenses for literature. Or, put simply...

... to help you _brainstorm_ what 'context' might mean **for the text you are studying** \- by giving you a series of prompts.

If instead you would prefer to find out [_how to use_ contextual knowledge](https://www.essaycoach.info/talk-about-context-in-your-literature-essay/), you might want to check out my guide to that [right here](https://www.essaycoach.info/talk-about-context-in-your-literature-essay/).

But first you need a good grasp of what 'context' actually is. And I think I can help with that:

Below is a list of my examples of contextual lenses for literature. The list is made up of prompts, and each prompt identifies a particular contextual angle from which, or 'lens' through which we can look at a text.

Lens... angle... whatever... they're both metaphors. The point is this:

**When you learn to look at literature in different ways, you get a better overall perspective.**

In this post I'm not really dealing with 'critical lenses' (e.g. formalist, feminist, Marxist etc) - although really those too are a _kind_ of context.

Because the context is everything that is _outside_ but _with_ the text: that's what 'con' means - 'with'.

So:

- Grab a sheet of paper
- Scroll down the list
- As you go, jot down the questions or topics which feel relevant to your text.
- You can then use this as a prompt list for a little bit of research.

## Background

Look - it may seem obvious, but...

... you can write better literature essays in the long-run if you recognise the different possible _meanings_ of the word 'context'.

> **Question:** How do I include context in my essay?  
> **Answer:** By first knowing what context _is_.

And yes. I know:

For lots of you...

... _it's a requirement (or an expectation) that you do so._

And I'll be honest:

I often read essays by students where their appreciation of what context _is_ is **too narrow or too fuzzy**.

That can mean:

1. It hinders you from doing **effective research**.
2. It stops you from picking up some **quick wins** where you actually know more context than you realise.
3. You try and bluff your way through it with bland generalisations about how things were in _ye olden dayes_.

So:

Here's my list of **different types of context in literature** - to give you some ideas about how you can [use context in an essay](https://www.essaycoach.info/talk-about-context-in-your-literature-essay/). Naturally, you don't have to use them all - but:

I find that students tend to have a bias towards a couple of them...

... and I have left those ones to the end!

Let's get to it.

## 1\. Cultural context

#### Cultural Context

This is a huge topic - and it absorbs some of the topics below.

In other words, in the particular time and place you are thinking of...

What sorts of communities existed? How were they composed?  
How do/did people think, express themselves?  
How did they spend their time?  
How did they perceive the world?  
What kinds of stories had they heard?  
How did they spend their free time (if they had any)?  
What were their ideas about right and wrong?

## 2\. Performative context

#### Performative Context

This one is especially important if you are studying a play - because the text was written for _performance on a stage_ by actors, and that is how the text was _received_ by its audience. By imagining how a particular scene might be staged and performed, and how it might be received, you are putting the text in context.

Mind you, this doesn't _exclude_ prose or poetry. Texts that are meant to be _read_ privately still get performed in the theatre of your mind - and it is often relevant that a text was written so that it would be read in solitariness and privacy.

It's often illuminating to use your imagination and think about how your text might typically be experienced. So give it a try.

Remember - by imagining and discussing how part of a text might be performed (or perhaps _was_ performed) you are putting it in context.

## 3\. Literary context

#### Literary Context

Students often neglect this one. This means _other texts_ that were written before your text - or even _since_ you text was written - and which _form part of its context_. That might mean:

- Other texts written by the same author
- Texts written by the author's contemporaries or near-contemporaries
- Canonical texts that loom large in the literary landscape - e.g. the Bible or the works of Shakespeare
- Texts that share something else _in common with your text_ \- perhaps in terms of genre, form, mode, plot, or theme.
- Texts that an author used directly as a source

## 4\. Socio-economic context

#### Socio-Economic Context

In a nutshell this usually means 'what daily life is/was like' for individuals and communities in a particular time and place. That includes:

- Poverty and prosperity
- The composition and distribution of communities
- The composition and structure of society
- The kind of work that different people did
- Settlement and migration
- The effects of advances in science and technology.

## 5\. Scientific context

#### Scientific Context

Advances in mathematics, medicine, physics, and so on form part of the context of all literature. Often this falls under _cultural_ context, though, because for the literary critic what matters is not so much the science itself as how science is/was generally **perceived and understood** - not just by scientists but by other people. For example, Charles Darwin's _The Origin of Species_ (1859) is a hugely important text in the context of practically everything that has been written since (and certainly a good deal of Victorian literature) - but what makes it important is that it _caused a sensation_ and ultimately changed the way that ordinary people perceive the world and the universe.

## 6\. Political context

#### Political Context

In the context of what political entity was your text written? A realm? A nation? An empire? A state? And how is/was it governed and administered? How much censorship was there? Were there hot topics of political debate? Was there public discourse about rights, laws, taxes, crime and punishment, or conquest and empire? Were there politcal rivalries or factions? Was there corruption? These are all the questions pertaining to political context which can shed light on a text.

## 7\. Religious and Humanist context

#### Religious and Humanist Context

By the light of religious contexts, texts can become:

provocative and subversive,

or

conservative and affirmative

or

somewhere between the two!

'Religious' context arguably falls under 'cultural' context - though there are often political implications too.

Clearly, wherever religious faith - or at least religious _observance_ and _practice_ and _affiliation_ - is widespread, it helps to determine and shape people's point of view, their loyalties, and their understanding of the world - including:

- moral codes
- ideas about order and hierarchy
- a sense of right and wrong.

## 8\. Biographical context

#### Biographical Context

The story of the author's life, his/her relationships, affiliations, beliefs, successes and failures - or the circumstances surrounding the writing of a particular text - _can_ sometimes shed light on that text. But:

Be careful.

Biographical context has a tendency to elicit bad habits from essay-writing students, including:

- Leaping to conclusions
- Simply dumping biographical information because it is easy to find and to repeat.

Never underestimate an author's ability to hold the reality of his/her life at arm's length whilst imagining completely different circumstances, in the interests of telling a good story or writing a beautiful poem.
